    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to create a platform so that users can add friends, share their thoughts, and react to each other's thoughts. Nowadays, the world is connected via the network and a part of human nature is to connect with each other no matter where each other is. I built this project because I want to help others easily connect with each other in the digital world and share experiences with friends, family, and loved ones.
        This platform is a solution for individuals who is looking for a easy-to-use app where they can connect with their friends easily. You can quickly and easily see other's thoughts and react to them, keep up with their latest doings. Through this project, I learned how to develop a backend using NoSQL and further my understanding of Express.js and working with local servers.

## About the Project

This project is a social network API. The API is built with Javascript, Mongoose, ExpressJS, and nodeJS. The MongoDB was used and to build and visualize the functionality and the localhost server, Insomnia and Studio 3T was used. In this system, the main components are being able to:

- Create, update, and delete user
- View all users and view a single user
- Create, update, and delete thoughts
- View all thoughts and view a single thought
- Add and remove friends
- Add and remove reactions from thoughts

## Installation

To be able to use this application, you need to git clone this repository into your local machine. 

You can then make your own `.env` file with the following information:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/networkDB
```

Once that's completed you can connect on Studio 3T

Next, you install packages that are needed to work this program:

```
npm init -y
npm install
npm install mongoose
npm install mongoDB
npm install express
npm install dotenv
```

Once those are installed, you can go ahead and run this command to start the system

```
npm run start
```

You should now be able to test out the functionality on Insomnia and see the database on Studio 3T.
